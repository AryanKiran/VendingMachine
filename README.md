# VendingMachine
The coffee vending machine system lets customers choose from various drinks and pay using cash, card, or mobile methods. It tracks inventory levels, dispenses the selected beverage, and gives change if needed. Administrators can update menu prices and view sales reports, while technicians handle maintenance and log their work.
